## Introduction

### The Problem We Solve

To get a job today, students need to show employers what they can actually do, not just show them good grades. The best way to do that is with an online portfolio that showcases their projects and skills. But for most students, making one is a huge pain. They either have to pay for expensive website builders every month, which they can't afford, or they have to build a website from scratch, which is too technical and takes too much time.

This isn't fair. It means that talented students miss out on internships and jobs just because they don't have the money or coding skills to show off their work properly.

### Our Solution: CodeFolio

**CodeFolio** is a free, easy-to-use platform designed specifically for students to create professional portfolios without any coding knowledge or monthly fees. Built by students, for students, CodeFolio makes it simple to showcase your projects, skills, and achievements in minutes—not hours.

### Setting Up Development Environment

#### Prerequisites

\`\`\`bash
Node.js 18+ 
npm or yarn
Firebase account
Vercel account (optional, for deployment)
\`\`\`

#### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd codefolio
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create `.env.local` file:
   \`\`\`
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   \`\`\`

4. **Set up Firestore**
   - Deploy `firestore.rules` to your Firebase project
   - Create indexes as needed (Firestore will prompt during development)

5. **Run development server**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`
   
   Open http://localhost:3000

#### Firestore Security Rules

Key rules to understand:

\`\`\`javascript
// Users can read/write own profile
allow read, update: if isOwner(userId);

// Posts are public read, authenticated write
allow read: if true;
allow create: if isAuthenticated();

// Notifications are private to recipient
allow read: if resource.data.toUserId == request.auth.uid;

// Connections require mutual consent
allow create: if request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
\`\`\`

### Known Issues & Technical Debt

1. **Connection Sync Permissions**
   - Issue: Firestore rules prevent updating other user's connection arrays
   - Workaround: `syncAcceptedConnections` function runs on user login
   - Fix Needed: Implement Cloud Functions for server-side connection updates

2. **Firebase Initialization in v0 Preview**
   - Issue: Firestore may fail to initialize in certain environments
   - Workaround: Debug warnings logged, graceful fallbacks
   - Note: Works properly when deployed to Vercel

3. **Image Optimization**
   - Issue: Large images slow down portfolio load times
   - Current: Client-side compression recommended
   - Fix Needed: Implement server-side image optimization (Next.js Image API)

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Issue: Live Feed requires manual refresh to see new posts
   - Current: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
   - Fix Needed: Implement Firestore real-time listeners

5. **Notification Count Race Conditions**
   - Issue: Counts may briefly show incorrect values during rapid updates
   - Workaround: Throttled refresh intervals
   - Fix Needed: Use Firestore aggregation queries (when available)

### Suggestions for Future Improvements

#### Short-Term (Next Sprint)
- **Email Notifications**: Send digest emails for connection requests
- **Advanced Search**: Filter profiles by school, major, graduation year
- **Post Reactions**: Add more reaction types beyond likes
- **Profile Views Analytics**: Show who viewed your portfolio

#### Medium-Term (Next Semester)
- **Messaging System**: Direct messages between connections
- **Groups/Communities**: Create school or major-specific groups
- **Events Calendar**: Post campus career fairs, hackathons
- **Endorsements**: Let connections endorse skills

#### Long-Term (Post-Graduation)
- **Job Board Integration**: Partner with employers for direct job postings
- **AI Resume Review**: Automated feedback on resumes
- **Portfolio Templates**: Pre-designed themes for different industries
- **Video Introductions**: 30-second intro videos on profiles
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track portfolio views, engagement metrics

### Contributing Guidelines

1. **Branch Naming**: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
2. **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
3. **Code Style**: Follow existing TypeScript/React patterns
4. **Testing**: Test on both mobile and desktop before PR
5. **Documentation**: Update this manual for significant feature changes
